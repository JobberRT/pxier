# Pxier -- Simple but powerful free proxy API server
*Pxier* is an API server based on multiple source of proxy providers, and it's built with [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo), using a `MySQL` database to store all the data.It also provider a `report` api for user to report a dead proxy, therefore *Pxier* could improve the quality in real-time<br>
*Pxier*'s source code is so simply that you can easily fork or pull request. It's designed to keep everything simple. <br>
-- *It just a proxy "scraper", why bother doing those fascinating abstraction stuff?*

### Before start using *Pxier*
- *Pxier* only doing the scraping stuff, what you plan to do with *Pxier* is your freedom, not *Pxier*'s business, nor responsible to *Pxier* 
- *Pxier* is designed to provider an all-in-one solution, for those who being scraped and feel offended, please open an issue, and I'll delete your source right away
- *Pixer* is an individual project, since it's a scraper, it needs feedback to fix bugs, and more validated source for more "All-In-One"
- *Pixer* is an individual project, means that I may have no much time for fixing bug, develop more feature, so if you want to get more cool stuff, welcome to contribute or fork then do it yourself
- *Pixer* is an open source and free project, you're welcome to use, modify, publish your version. But since I don't know that deep about open source license and don't want to spend time for it, I think just put my words here is good enough: *If you planned to publish your own fork version, please name the origin author. If you planned to use in a commercial project, you MUST contact me first and MUST NOT use it before I agree.*
